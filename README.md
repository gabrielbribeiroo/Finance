## Brazilian Financial Planning and Interest Comparison System

---

### Description
TaxCalcBR is a comprehensive financial planning and analysis system designed for the **Brazilian market**. It combines a **Python backend** (primarily for exploring data sourcing and backend logic) and a **dynamic web interface** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The system empowers users to compare various payment scenarios, understand interest impacts, and simulate investment returns based on real-time financial indices.

### Features
* **Real-Time Financial Indices**: Displays the current **SELIC** (annualized) and **IPCA** (12-month accumulated) rates, fetched directly from the Brazilian Central Bank for immediate financial context.
* **7 Detailed Comparison Modes**: Offers diverse financial analysis options to suit various needs:
    * **Yield vs. Installments**: Analyze the effective cost considering potential investment yields and cash discounts.
    * **Cash vs. Installments**: Directly compare different offer values.
    * **Down Payment + Installments vs. Cash**: Evaluate scenarios involving an initial down payment, now including investment simulation to assess true cost.
    * **Compare Two Installment Options**: Determine the most cost-effective choice between two payment plans.
    * **Late Payment Impact**: Calculate the corrected value of overdue installments, factoring in penalties and daily interest.
    * **Inflation Simulation**: Understand the real value of future payments by calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) with estimated inflation.
    * **Alternative Investment Comparison**: See if investing a lump sum while making installment payments is more advantageous than an outright cash purchase.
* **Compound Interest Calculations**: Supports intricate interest calculations, with or without **Income Tax (IR)** considerations on investment yields, applying Brazilian tax rules.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Features a **responsive web interface** with dynamic input fields that adapt instantly to the selected analysis option, providing **real-time calculations** without page reloads.
* **Robust Input Handling**: Ensures flexible and reliable processing of numerical inputs, accommodating common Brazilian number formatting (e.g., values with commas or periods).
* **Modular Architecture**: Designed with a clear separation between calculation logic (`script.js`) and visual components, making it easy to maintain, test, and expand.

### System Modeling
The system intelligently processes financial data to:
* Convert interest rates between different periods (e.g., annual to monthly) accurately.
* Perform cumulative calculations, such as annualized returns, leveraging **compound interest** principles.
* Compare various payment and investment strategies using robust mathematical formulas and established financial models.

### Data Manipulation
* **Real-time Data Retrieval**: Connects directly to the **Brazilian Central Bank API** to fetch up-to-date **SELIC** and **IPCA** rates, ensuring all calculations are based on current market conditions.
* **Data Validation**: Ensures raw input data is properly formatted and free from extraneous characters, preventing calculation errors and improving reliability.
* **Financial Algorithms**: Implements precise mathematical formulas for reliable financial projections and comprehensive comparative analysis.

### Web Interface
The interactive web-based graphical interface is developed using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**:
* **Dynamic Inputs**: Input fields automatically adjust and appear/disappear based on the user's selected analysis option, streamlining the user experience and preventing unnecessary clutter.
* **Real-Time Results**: Calculations are performed instantly, and results are displayed dynamically on the same page, eliminating the need for page reloads and providing immediate feedback.
* **Smooth Navigation**: The interface automatically scrolls to display the results after a calculation is performed, ensuring optimal usability and a seamless user flow.
